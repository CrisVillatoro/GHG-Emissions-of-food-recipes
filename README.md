# GHG Emissions of food recipes ðŸŒ±

As the final project of the 12-week Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy GmbH, I did a project consisting of 5 different objectives:

1. [Dashboard](https://github.com/CrisVillatoro/Dashboard-Environmental-footprint-of-food-products): Build an interactive web application using Dash (Flask-plotly). 
2. Pre-process and clean the recipes and the environmental footprint of food products datasets.
3. Build a LSTM (Long short-term memory) Recurrent Neural Network model for text generation.
4. Calculate the environmental footprint of each of the recipes.
5. Put objectives 2, 3 and 4 on a Streamlit App.
